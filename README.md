## Description
`cPanel Discovery` is a basic tool intended for **CTF, training, and authorized security assessments only**. It provides two menu options:

2. **cPanel Brute Force (Mock)** — able to bruteforce cpanels.

This repository is **NOT** intended or authorized for any illegal scanning, brute forcing, or attacking of systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
